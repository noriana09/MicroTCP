📄 MicroTCP: Lightweight TCP over UDP
📝 Description

This project implements a lightweight TCP protocol over UDP, designed for IoT devices with limited resources. It provides reliable communication using UDP, focusing on connection establishment and termination. The project is divided into two phases:

Phase A: Basic MicroTCP implementation, including 3-way handshake and connection termination.
Phase B: Advanced features like acknowledgments, retransmissions, and congestion control.
This repository contains the Phase A implementation.
